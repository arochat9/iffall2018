    <h1>Feedback that was provided to me</h1>
    <h2>Feedback from Lily</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>for the links at the bottom - clean them up.  Hyperlink the links at the bottom.  Also clean up the formatting</li>
      <li>Top section with the picture is good.  She likes how the picture is faded in the back</li>
      <li>Try making the font a different color instead of just black.  Maybe try doing a dark blue or something like that.</li>
      <li>Change the nutrition box to make it easier to read.  It could help to make it an actual list</li>
      <li>the light blue of the bullets clash with the dark blue of the headlines.  Maybe choose a color thats in the headline gradient.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Feedback from Kristina</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A lot of the feedback overlapped with Lily's feedback</li>
      <li>Some additional advice that I was given was to make the urls an actual hyperlink at the bottom, and potentially make the citations bullets or asterisks</li>
      <li>I could also add some interactive elements to the website, maybe with the tips and nutrition facts sections.</li>
    </ul>
