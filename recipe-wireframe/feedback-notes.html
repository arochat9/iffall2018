    <h1>Feedback that was provided to me</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>The first thing that was recommended to me was to change the two columns that I have into 1 column.  When I originally did the wireframe I thought it was going to be for a desktop, so two columns made sense then.  For the phone, two columns are just a little two crammed in.</li>
      <li>The next thing we talked about was having a margin on either side of the content.  I like the idea of having a set margin, just because I donâ€™t like when the content takes up the entire width of the screen. </li>
      <li>We also talked about how my image was too long and it would be hard to find a photo that long.  For a mobile phone however, I said that this width will not actually be as big as I drew it on paper.</li>
      <li>Another thing that I think may be hard to make is to put different images alongside the directions and ingredient sections.  I think this might help the user make the food, however it will be hard to make a bunch of different food images work alongside instructions.</li>
      <li>We also talked about styling the bullets, potentially by putting a circle around each number for directions and instructions.  This may be hard to do in css though, so this feature may not get implemented.</li>
      <li>Finally, another thing I did not consider was that I was going to have to site my images.  To do this, I am going to have a small footnotes section at the bottom of my page with urls to the image sites.</li>
    </ul>
