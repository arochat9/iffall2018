	<!-- <h1>Feedback for Katie S.</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Your images are really big. They took my computer some time to load so I am guessing they are bigger resolution then they need to be.</li>
		<li>I like the contrast of the white with your images, maybe try adding a text shadow.</li>
		<li>Your first phone image seems sort of cramped with the text, you could potentially put the text at the bottom, that way you could make the font size a bit bigger and more readable.</li>
		<li>I like the second phone image with the quote, however I think it is to big of a jump from the placement of the desktop image with the quote.  As a solution, I think you could put the desktop text on the right side of the image, instead of the left.  That way when it switches to phone, it only has to move a little bit to get to the bottom left.</li>
		<li>For your third image, I like that you moved to cut off the left side of the park.  I think the third one is good, just make sure the font stays readable for the smaller phone sizes.</li>

	<h1>Feedback for Brandon</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Hey, so for the first image, I think it might be kind of a hard transition to jump all the way from the right side of her body to the left side of her face.  You could potentially make the mobile version go to the top right instead of the top left.  That would also be a lot easier to design.</li>
		<li>The contrast between the white text and the light green background is sort of light in the first image.  Potentially use a text shadow or a darker background.</li>
		<li>Again for the second image, jumping from one side to the other is going to be sort of difficult, so maybe just leave the text on the left side of the guys head.</li>
		<li>I really like the third image, I think its cool that you put "- Anon" on the other side of the quote, and then for the mobile image they both move to the top.  I also like the color contrast between the white image and the black background.</li>
		<li>One more thing, it looks like for the mobile images the quote name "Anon" is usually bigger than the quote.  Maybe try resizing the font for the name.</li>
