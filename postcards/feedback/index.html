	<h1>Feedback for Katie S.</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Your images are really big. They took my computer some time to load so I am guessing they are bigger resolution then they need to be.</li>
		<li>I like the contrast of the white with your images, maybe try adding a text shadow.</li>
		<li>Your first phone image seems sort of cramped with the text, you could potentially put the text at the bottom, that way you could make the font size a bit bigger and more readable.</li>
		<li>I like the second phone image with the quote, however I think it is to big of a jump from the placement of the desktop image with the quote.  As a solution, I think you could put the desktop text on the right side of the image, instead of the left.  That way when it switches to phone, it only has to move a little bit to get to the bottom left.</li>
		<li>For your third image, I like that you moved to cut off the left side of the park.  I think the third one is good, just make sure the font stays readable for the smaller phone sizes.</li>
